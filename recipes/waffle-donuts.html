\    <h2><em>"Two classics come together to create the best breakfast treat ever."</em></h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prepare Batter</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your waffle iron.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl whisk together milk, apple butter, maple syrup, melted butter, and eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine. If the batter seems too thick, thin it out with more
        milk until the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Cook your waffles according to the manufacturer's directions for your waffle maker, and let them cool. (Mini waffles
        will cook faster than full sized.)</li>
        <li>Prepare the glaze. In a large bowl whisk together powdered sugar, 4 Tablespoons of milk and vanilla. The glaze will be
        think but not as thick as frosting. If it appears too think, thin it out with more milk. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a high-sided pan with 2 inches of vegetable oil. Bring the oil to 365 degrees F. Once the oil is hot, add in about
        4 waffles at a time and fry for 5 seconds on each side. (They should just crisp and turn a dark golden brown color.)</li>
        <li>Continue until all of the waffles are fried.</li>
        <li>Dip waffles one at a time into the glaze and let them cool on a rack in a rimmed baking sheet to harden. Serve the same
        day as making.</li>
    </ol>
